# Accessability on the web

> When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. However, currently many sites and tools are developed with accessibility barriers that make them difficult or impossible for some people to use.

from [w3c Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/)

## Goals

This site is an attempt to explain as simple as possible the basics of web accessability for developers. This is done with links, references and examples.

## Examples
Examples taken from different tutorials (mainly MDN):  
    [Level A Basic](/accessibility/docs/LevelA)
    [Level AA Advance](/accessibility/docs/LevelAA)
