# Language

## Using clear language

- Don't use dashes if you can avoid it. Instead of writing 5–7, write 5 to 7.
- Expand abbreviations — instead of writing Jan, write January.
- Expand acronyms, at least once or twice, then use the <abbr> tag to describe them.

❌ **Don’t** dashes, abbreviations only acronyms:
```html
<div>The show will play at 5–7 Jan</div>
```  
✅ **Do** expanded explanations:
```html
<div>The show will play between 5th and 7th of January</div>
```
