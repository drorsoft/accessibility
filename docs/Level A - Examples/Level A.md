# Level A
The success criteria at Level A are designed to be the **easiest to meet**, without much impact on the website design or structure.

For example, at Level A you aren’t allowed to identify something by color alone, like “Press the green button to proceed”.
Your site probably passes this example already unless it has a load of complex data charts on it that have colored legends.[^1]
