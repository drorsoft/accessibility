# Level AAA
At Level AAA, the requirement is taken further with an **even more strict** color contrast requirement for text. Essentially you can only use very dark colors on a very light background and vice versa. Almost all colored text fails.

Your average website doesnâ€™t target Level AAA conformance, that level tends to be for pretty specialist sites as the criteria are really strict. That's not to say that they aren't helpful and it's a good idea to at least understand them as there might be examples that are easy for your site to meet.[^1]

## AAA Rules

### Contrast
Contrast ratio between text and background is at least 7 to 1.

### Video
Pre-recorded video content must have a sign language translation.
Extended audio description should be provided for pre-recorded videos.
