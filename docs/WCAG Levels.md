## WCAG Levels

## History

 In 1999 the Web Accessibility Initiative, a project by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), published the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 1.0.

On 11 December 2008, the WAI released the WCAG 2.0 as a Recommendation. WCAG 2.0 aims to be up to date and more technology neutral.[^1] 

## WCAG

WCAG is now on version 2.0 and there is a draft for version 3.0. The standard defines three levels of conformance:

* [Level A](LevelA) - is the minimum level.
* [Level AA](LevelAA) - includes all Level A and AA requirements. Many organizations strive to meet Level AA.
* [Level AAA](LevelAAA) -  includes all Level A, AA, and AAA requirements.

In many countries the standard that is set by law is the AA level.
